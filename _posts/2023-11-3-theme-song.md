Before recently, the theme song was **ALWAYS** *The Great Strategy 2* by BadLiZ. Now the time has come to usher in the end of an era. As of November 2nd, the old old song is no longer the theme for the game. A new song has been **handpicked** from the craftsman's vault of homemade songs (**INCLUDING** the one that is now the official theme). Here it is, folks:

The theme is based on the songs "Rumbling of the Rangers" and "From Hawks to Brigadiers" from the last map album released. However, that is only partially relevant. This deserves a history lesson - about the theme itself. Before this moment, TGS2 (The Great Strategy 2) was **ALWAYS** the de-facto theme. However, there was an attempt in 2019.  due to the technology and experience used at the time, it failed. It would be picked up until only recently (last month). And here we are - doing it.

Special thanks to all of those who helped improve my skills as well as gave insights on how to imprve the theme itself. Without your support, this post would be meaningless.
