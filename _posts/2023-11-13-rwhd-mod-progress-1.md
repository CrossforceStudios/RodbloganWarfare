For a while, there's been a mod being constructed for Operation: Harsh Doorstop. The name is RW:Harsh Doorstop.

## Goal

The aim of this mod is mainly to bring the formula that makes RW (On Roblox) unique to the standalone market (i.e. a game of our own or a mod of a game).

## Progress?

Here's what we have so far (A note will be provided below for those who are unaware of happen on our end regarding equipment)

### Icons and Factions

Due to copyright concerns (since 2022),  the names from the original game for the leading Rodblogan Entente forces have changed. They are:

1. Robians (Robloxian Republic)
2. Boxers (Bloxxer Confederation)

The Icons are shown in this screenshot:

### Scoreboard

The scoreboard is a **MAJOR** change (literally and metaphorically) for the **ENTIRE** franchise. The reason is due to a lacking one in the original game. the scoreboard below could be seen in RW: The Cherished Companies but with some serious changes. Here's the screenshot:

The red and blue text is only unchangeable in the mod. In TCC (The Cherished Companies), the text will be able to change colors (to that of the faction in question). Also, ping won't be available on TCC's scoreboard due to major differences in how things are handled between the two environments (The mod's game and the game on Roblox).

## What Happened?

Unfortunately, the drive in which the first copy of the mod was stored only finally malfunctioned. Aftwards, the machine that it was initally started on broke down not too long afterwards. Fortunately, we are back in the fight (TCC's work has resumed). However, the first copy wasn't backed up, so a second one was created. With the lessons of the first, this should be back up soon.
