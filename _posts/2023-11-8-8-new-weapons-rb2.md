So, we're here, folks. Roots Block II is underway, and there are  **MULTIPLE** new weapons coming in this update. Here are **three** of the most notable additions:


## AKM

A classic assault rifle made by the soviets, the AKM is one of the Bloxxers' most revered service rifles ever use. We decided to reinstate it to make way for better animations as well as more specific things. This rifle will be **as accurate as possible** when released. It is also going to be fine-tuned for combat in multiple areas (including in the animations department).

## RPG-7

A rocket launcher that deserves a second chance and a second change. This launcher was supposed to be the goto for the Bloxxer Confederation (yes even after the end of the Insurgent Era).  It's best traits are its reusability and the potency of the rockets.

## M72 LAW

This launcher is supposed to be the first alternative to the Panzerfuast 3 (as a whole). The last time it was in-game was in 2018, so this is a **MAJOR** comeback if successful.

Either way, all of the aforementioned weapons will be bresent by the closing of Block II. The AI will also receive the ability to use these and many other planned weapons.
