**NOTE:** This article is still under construction. It should be up by Christmas night. Thank you for your understamding and patience.

It is finally Chirstmas Day, 2023. After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, Rodblogan Warfare has more waffen than it had in 2022.
After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, RW finally has a main theme of its own. After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, RWHD is starting to look real.
After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, bugs that were a bane in 2021 have been removed. After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, The characters look new again. You get the point - progress has been made extensively. However, has it been enough to stick? Or was it in vain? Let's find out!

## Characters

The outfits of **EVERY FACTION IN THE GAME** has been revamped. Our team (2 men, I know) have managed to redo them after 3 years of service. The old ones had their merits - but their flaws were already evident by 2023. So here are the newest ones:

### 1. Robloxian (Robian) Infantry

The backbone of the Robloxian Republic, this unit how has a better representation of itself than in 2022. In 2022, it was perceived as a police force. Now, it's perceived as a full 
fighting force. This Republic trooper now has new classes that mostly replaced the old ones:

- Support Infantry (replaces most Bandoliers)
- Support Infantry 2nd Class (replaces Partisan Marksman)
- Specialized Infantry (replaces Breach Infantry)

#### 2. Robloxian (Robian) Officer

The squad leader, medic and architect are all in this one. A lot of classes have been replaced here, so let's show them below:

- Assistant Personnel (replaces the Assistant Bandolier)
- Commanding Personnel (New Unit - acts as a squad leader)
- Medic Personnel (replaces M.O.U)
- Constructive Personnel (replaces G.O.U)
- Gunsmith Personnel (New Unit - provides in-field maintenance to armaments)
