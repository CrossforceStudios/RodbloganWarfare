**NOTE:** This article is still under construction. It should be up by Christmas night. Thank you for your understamding and patience.

It is finally Chirstmas Day, 2023. After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, Rodblogan Warfare has more waffen than it had in 2022.
After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, RW finally has a main theme of its own. After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, RWHD is starting to look real.
After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, bugs that were a bane in 2021 have been removed. After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, The characters look new again. You get the point - progress has been made extensively. However, has it been enough to stick? Or was it in vain? Let's find out!

## Characters

The outfits of **EVERY FACTION IN THE GAME** has been revamped. Our team (2 men, I know) have managed to redo them after 3 years of service. The old ones had their merits - but their flaws were already evident by 2023. So here are the newest ones:

### 1. Robloxian (Robian) Infantry

The backbone of the Robloxian Republic, this unit how has a better representation of itself than in 2022. In 2022, it was perceived as a police force. Now, it's perceived as a full 
fighting force. This Republic trooper now has new classes that mostly replaced the old ones:

- **Support Infantry (replaces most Bandoliers)**
- **Support Infantry 2nd Class (replaces Partisan Marksman)**
- **Specialized Infantry (replaces Breach Infantry)**

#### 2. Robloxian (Robian) Officer

The squad leader, medic and architect are all in this one. A lot of classes have been replaced here, so let's show them below:

- **Assistant Personnel (replaces the Assistant Bandolier)**
- **Commanding Personnel (New Unit - acts as a squad leader)**
- **Medic Personnel (replaces M.O.U)**
- **Constructive Personnel (replaces G.O.U)**
- **Gunsmith Personnel (New Unit - provides in-field maintenance to armaments)**

#### 3. Robloxian (Robian) Technician

The heavier, utilitarian Crewman unit of the Republic has an even simpler look and feel to it than the previously mentioned unit. As a result some alterations were made (such as gloves). Here are the confirmed sub-units: 

- **Gunner Crewman (replaces the Gunner Bandolier)**
- **Artillery Crewman (replaces the E.O.U)**
- **Vehicle Crewman (replaces PARTIALLY the Tanker Bandolier and the Outcast)**
- **Naval Crewman Personnel (New Unit - used on warships and small gunboats)**
- **Pilot Crewman (New Unit - provides air support MANUALLY)**

#### 4. Robloxian (Robian) Ranger

The classic marksman has also been reworked - both physically and functionally. Here are the new sub-units: 

- **Sabotage Marksman (replaces the Sharpshooter Marksman)**

Also, Marksmen also received access to DMRs for the first time ever. This is due to the ambiguity of the rifles in the hands of precise personnel (such as the Support Infantry 2nd Class and the Marksman).

#### 5. Bloxxer (Robian) Insurgent

![Bloxxer Insurgent](assets/img/xmasreport-05.png)

The Bloxxers' Infantry have **ALWAYS** been known as insurgents (in the lore) since the 1980s. However, when the insurgency became a confederate entity in 2002, The Robloxians and other free Rodblogan States (yes - the Dominion and Telagans are included here) became **VERY** concerned. This was only (in the lore) exactly 5 months after the 9/11 attacks took place in the USA. When the Bloxxer-Robloxian war broke out vehemently on November 28th, 2009 (in the game and the lore), the gear that they wore scare **THE LIVING DAYLGHTS** out of many Dominion troops that fought that day. In other terms, never would anyone think the Confederation would be capable of fighting their enemies in this fashion (they were insurgents before this).
