**NOTE:** This article is still under construction. It should be up by Christmas night. Thank you for your understamding and patience.

It is finally Chirstmas Day, 2023. After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, Rodblogan Warfare has more waffen than it had in 2022.
After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, RW finally has a main theme of its own. After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, RWHD is starting to look real.
After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, bugs that were a bane in 2021 have been removed. After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, The characters look new again. You get the point - progress has been made extensively. However, has it been enough to stick? Or was it in vain? Let's find out!

## Characters

The outfits of **EVERY FACTION IN THE GAME** has been revamped. Our team (2 men, I know) have managed to redo them after 3 years of service. The old ones had their merits - but their flaws were already evident by 2023. So here are the newest ones:

### 1. Robloxian (Robian) Infantry

![Robloxian Gendarme](assets/img/xmasreport-01.png)

The backbone of the Robloxian Republic, this unit how has a better representation of itself than in 2022. In 2022, it was perceived as a police force. Now, it's perceived as a full 
fighting force. This Republic trooper now has new classes that mostly replaced the old ones:

- **Support Infantry (replaces most Bandoliers)**
- **Support Infantry 2nd Class (replaces Partisan Marksman)**
- **Specialized Infantry (replaces Breach Infantry)**

### 2. Robloxian (Robian) Officer

![Robloxian Officer](assets/img/xmasreport-02.png)

The squad leader, medic and architect are all in this one. A lot of classes have been replaced here, so let's show them below:

- **Assistant Personnel (replaces the Assistant Bandolier)**
- **Commanding Personnel (New Unit - acts as a squad leader)**
- **Medic Personnel (replaces M.O.U)**
- **Constructive Personnel (replaces G.O.U)**
- **Gunsmith Personnel (New Unit - provides in-field maintenance to armaments)**

### 3. Robloxian (Robian) Technician


![Robloxian Technician](assets/img/xmasreport-03.png)

The heavier, utilitarian Crewman unit of the Republic has an even simpler look and feel to it than the previously mentioned unit. As a result some alterations were made (such as gloves). Here are the confirmed sub-units: 

- **Gunner Crewman (replaces the Gunner Bandolier)**
- **Artillery Crewman (replaces the E.O.U)**
- **Vehicle Crewman (replaces PARTIALLY the Tanker Bandolier and the Outcast)**
- **Naval Crewman Personnel (New Unit - used on warships and small gunboats)**
- **Pilot Crewman (New Unit - provides air support MANUALLY)**

### 4. Robloxian (Robian) Ranger

![Robloxian Ranger](assets/img/xmasreport-04.png)

The classic marksman has also been reworked - both physically and functionally. Here are the new sub-units: 

- **Sabotage Marksman (replaces the Sharpshooter Marksman)**

Also, Marksmen also received access to DMRs for the first time ever. This is due to the ambiguity of the rifles in the hands of precise personnel (such as the Support Infantry 2nd Class and the Marksman).

### 5. Bloxxer (Boxer) Insurgent

![Bloxxer Insurgent](assets/img/xmasreport-05.png)

The Bloxxers' Infantry have **ALWAYS** been known as insurgents (in the lore) since the 1980s. However, when the insurgency became a confederate entity in 2002, The Robloxians and other free Rodblogan States (yes - the Dominion and Telagans are included here) became **VERY** concerned. This was only (in the lore) exactly 5 months after the 9/11 attacks took place in the USA. When the Bloxxer-Robloxian war broke out vehemently on November 28th, 2009 (in the game and the lore), the gear that they wore scare **THE LIVING DAYLGHTS** out of many Dominion troops that fought that day. In other terms, never would anyone think the Confederation would be capable of fighting their enemies in this fashion (they were insurgents before this).

### 5. Bloxxer (Boxer) Militant

![Bloxxer Militant](assets/img/xmasreport-05.png)

The Bloxxer Militant is a reminder that they are terrorists at the end of the day (as a group without the individual). Taking its look from the IRA and various other terror organizations, this CO is a Crossroader's worst nightmare. When the Siege of the Crossroads began, the Militants were also seen in the second stage - scaring the crap out of the Dominion troops fighting them in the process. The inhuman mask that they wear screams of a cold soul - one that *doesn't give a damn* about the circumtances nor identity of their enemies. You see, unlike the Yakuza no Bushi (ヤクザ の 武士), The Militant cannot think (against war crimes  and other atrocities) clearly due to **YEARS** of training. This training ultimately hardened them against being defectors. At the end of the war, **NO MILITANT** was spared. 

### 6. Bloxxer (Boxer) Partisan

![Bloxxer Partisan](assets/img/xmasreport-06.png)

The Bloxxer Partisan is the **ultimate** Militant. Capable of manning .50 cal. MGs, Grenade MGs, rocket launchers and even AV-18/19 attack helicopters, these enemies are not to be toyed with.


### 7. Other Units

Many other units have been improved as well. The unit system overhaul was the first in 3 years and the most practical implementation of a class system the game has ever seen in its nearly 6-year history.


## Maps

Five new maps were introduced to The Cherished Companies. They are:

1. Ultima Expanse
2. La Petite Carentan
3. Fort Vulcan
4. The Lucas Line
5. Emerald Forest (Winter)

Let's go over them.

### Ultima Expanse

![Bloxxer side of the Ultima Expanse](assets/img/xmasreport-07.png)

More than two years after the failure that was Ultima Run, A new version of Ultima was born. That was Ultima Expanse. Now, the newer map contains a vast jungle veiling the old cover that was part of Ultima Run and the original map. It also features sniper towers that can be entered using climbing.

### La Petite Carentan

Widely regarded as one of the prettiest maps ever made in Rodblogan Warfare history, this rural map contains many autmnal trees and contemporary elements. Recently, it got a second makeover to enhance that beauty and allow for better gameplay.

### Fort Vulcan

![Fort Vulcan in view during an AK inspect animation](assets/img/xmasreport-09.png)

The first-ever war group map isn't just that - it's also a **MAJOR** development in the music department. The theme for the map is named Walking on Eggshells. It also happens to be the inspiration for "Rumbling of the Rangers", "From Hawks to Brigadiers" and of course, the game's main theme.

### The Lucas Line

![One of the Lucas Line trenches](assets/img/xmasreport-10.jpg)

The Lucas Line was a reincarnation of The Underground War, a map made by the new version's namesake ([@stickmasterluke](https://www.roblox.com/users/80254/profile)). It's new focus (major improvement) was the "underground" aspect for the map - the Wartime Tunnels (SCP-style tunnels that run underneath the battlefield). According to lore, the raids between Bloxxers and Robloxians would happen under there as well as above-ground. This is due to the line being a borderland (indicated by the ruins of a former farm in the area).

### Emerald Forest (Winter Edition)

The Emerald Forest has now become engulfed in winter's gaze - covered in white and devoid of the green and the tents that stood in this forest. This map was also part of a **MAJOR** effort to increase the amount of alpine maps in the game (stems back to 2019 with *proposed* winter variants of the Crossroads).

## Customization

A lot has happened this year regarding the customization of weapons, so let's see it!

### Furnitures & Alloys

<img src="assets/img/xmasreport-11.png" class="img-large">


In January, 7 new furnitures were added for the FX-05 rifles and carbines. Some were solid colors, but 4 were ***very*** special. These camos haven't seen the light of day in RW since 2019. However, that changes with the reintroduction of these types of camos. Also, the SA80s received a new Tan Furniture and a new Green Furniture - the first ever for the new rifle. The Colt Python and HK21 also received furnitures/alloys as of April and June of 2023 (repsectively).

## Magazines

In 2023, The Thompsons (M1921-M1A1) received a new 20-round box magazine. Other than that (and those of new weapons), this is all there is.

## Attachments

**MANY** attachments were added to Rodblogan Warfare this year. Here are prominent ones:

### Colt Python Barrels

<video src="assets/img/xmasreport-12.mp4"></video>

Both the stubby and targeting versions of the Colt Python's barrel came back this year. Returning in April, these barrels paved the way for the furniutre additions menitoned above as well as heavy sound changes to the longtime Revolver.

### G3SG/1 Stock

The G3SG/1 Stock being added was also major to RW. With the addition of the rail mount, the Stock was just another puzzle piece to complete the construction of a makeshift G3SG/1 rifle **in-game**. Combined with the strengths of the HK31A3 (G3A3 in other games), this stock makes it almost feel real.

### Ultradot PANAV

The PANAV is a new sight that slightly resembles the Kobra in Phantom Forces. The main difference? The reticle is interchangeable **in-game**. This attachment is the first of its kind - an attachment that *immediately* switches to a new reticle when the sight is adjusted.
