**NOTE:** This article is still under construction. It should be up by Christmas night. Thank you for your understamding and patience.

It is finally Chirstmas Day, 2023. After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, Rodblogan Warfare has more waffen than it had in 2022.
After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, RW finally has a main theme of its own. After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, RWHD is starting to look real.
After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, bugs that were a bane in 2021 have been removed. After 11 cold, but hard-fought months, The characters look new again. You get the point - progress has been made extensively. However, has it been enough to stick? Or was it in vain? Let's find out!

## Characters

The outfits of **EVERY FACTION IN THE GAME** has been revamped. Our team (2 men, I know) have managed to redo them after 3 years of service. The old ones had their merits - but their flaws were already evident by 2023. So here are the newest ones:

### 1. Robloxian (Robian) Infantry

![Robloxian Gendarme](assets/img/xmasreport-01.png)

The backbone of the Robloxian Republic, this unit how has a better representation of itself than in 2022. In 2022, it was perceived as a police force. Now, it's perceived as a full 
fighting force. This Republic trooper now has new classes that mostly replaced the old ones:

- **Support Infantry (replaces most Bandoliers)**
- **Support Infantry 2nd Class (replaces Partisan Marksman)**
- **Specialized Infantry (replaces Breach Infantry)**

### 2. Robloxian (Robian) Officer

![Robloxian Officer](assets/img/xmasreport-02.png)

The squad leader, medic and architect are all in this one. A lot of classes have been replaced here, so let's show them below:

- **Assistant Personnel (replaces the Assistant Bandolier)**
- **Commanding Personnel (New Unit - acts as a squad leader)**
- **Medic Personnel (replaces M.O.U)**
- **Constructive Personnel (replaces G.O.U)**
- **Gunsmith Personnel (New Unit - provides in-field maintenance to armaments)**

### 3. Robloxian (Robian) Technician


![Robloxian Technician](assets/img/xmasreport-03.png)

The heavier, utilitarian Crewman unit of the Republic has an even simpler look and feel to it than the previously mentioned unit. As a result some alterations were made (such as gloves). Here are the confirmed sub-units: 

- **Gunner Crewman (replaces the Gunner Bandolier)**
- **Artillery Crewman (replaces the E.O.U)**
- **Vehicle Crewman (replaces PARTIALLY the Tanker Bandolier and the Outcast)**
- **Naval Crewman Personnel (New Unit - used on warships and small gunboats)**
- **Pilot Crewman (New Unit - provides air support MANUALLY)**

### 4. Robloxian (Robian) Ranger

<img src="assets/img/xmasreport-04" class="img-large">

The classic marksman has also been reworked - both physically and functionally. Here are the new sub-units: 

- **Sabotage Marksman (replaces the Sharpshooter Marksman)**

Also, Marksmen also received access to DMRs for the first time ever. This is due to the ambiguity of the rifles in the hands of precise personnel (such as the Support Infantry 2nd Class and the Marksman).

### 5. Bloxxer (Boxer) Insurgent

![Bloxxer Insurgent](assets/img/xmasreport-05.png)

The Bloxxers' Infantry have **ALWAYS** been known as insurgents (in the lore) since the 1980s. However, when the insurgency became a confederate entity in 2002, The Robloxians and other free Rodblogan States (yes - the Dominion and Telagans are included here) became **VERY** concerned. This was only (in the lore) exactly 5 months after the 9/11 attacks took place in the USA. When the Bloxxer-Robloxian war broke out vehemently on November 28th, 2009 (in the game and the lore), the gear that they wore scare **THE LIVING DAYLGHTS** out of many Dominion troops that fought that day. In other terms, never would anyone think the Confederation would be capable of fighting their enemies in this fashion (they were insurgents before this).

### 5. Bloxxer (Boxer) Militant

![Bloxxer Militant](assets/img/xmasreport-05.png)

The Bloxxer Militant is a reminder that they are terrorists at the end of the day (as a group without the individual). Taking its look from the IRA and various other terror organizations, this CO is a Crossroader's worst nightmare. When the Siege of the Crossroads began, the Militants were also seen in the second stage - scaring the crap out of the Dominion troops fighting them in the process. The inhuman mask that they wear screams of a cold soul - one that *doesn't give a damn* about the circumtances nor identity of their enemies. You see, unlike the Yakuza no Bushi (ヤクザ の 武士), The Militant cannot think (against war crimes  and other atrocities) clearly due to **YEARS** of training. This training ultimately hardened them against being defectors. At the end of the war, **NO MILITANT** was spared. 

### 6. Bloxxer (Boxer) Partisan

![Bloxxer Partisan](assets/img/xmasreport-06.png)

The Bloxxer Partisan is the **ultimate** Militant. Capable of manning .50 cal. MGs, Grenade MGs, rocket launchers and even AV-18/19 attack helicopters, these enemies are not to be toyed with.


### 7. Other Units

Many other units have been improved as well. The unit system overhaul was the first in 3 years and the most practical implementation of a class system the game has ever seen in its nearly 6-year history.


## Maps

Five new maps were introduced to The Cherished Companies. They are:

1. Ultima Expanse
2. La Petite Carentan
3. Fort Vulcan
4. The Lucas Line
5. Emerald Forest (Winter)

Let's go over them.

### Ultima Expanse

<img src="assets/img/xmasreport-07.png" class="img-large">


More than two years after the failure that was Ultima Run, A new version of Ultima was born. That was Ultima Expanse. Now, the newer map contains a vast jungle veiling the old cover that was part of Ultima Run and the original map. It also features sniper towers that can be entered using climbing.

### La Petite Carentan

<img src="assets/img/xmasreport-08.jpg" class="img-large">


Widely regarded as one of the prettiest maps ever made in Rodblogan Warfare history, this rural map contains many autmnal trees and contemporary elements. Recently, it got a second makeover to enhance that beauty and allow for better gameplay.

### Fort Vulcan

<img src="assets/img/xmasreport-09.png" class="img-large">


The first-ever war group map isn't just that - it's also a **MAJOR** development in the music department. The theme for the map is named Walking on Eggshells. It also happens to be the inspiration for "Rumbling of the Rangers", "From Hawks to Brigadiers" and of course, the game's main theme.

### The Lucas Line

<img src="assets/img/xmasreport-10.jpg" class="img-large">


The Lucas Line was a reincarnation of The Underground War, a map made by the new version's namesake ([@stickmasterluke](https://www.roblox.com/users/80254/profile)). It's new focus (major improvement) was the "underground" aspect for the map - the Wartime Tunnels (SCP-style tunnels that run underneath the battlefield). According to lore, the raids between Bloxxers and Robloxians would happen under there as well as above-ground. This is due to the line being a borderland (indicated by the ruins of a former farm in the area).

### Emerald Forest (Winter Edition)

<img src="assets/img/xmasreport-16.jpg" class="img-large">


The Emerald Forest has now become engulfed in winter's gaze - covered in white and devoid of the green and the tents that stood in this forest. This map was also part of a **MAJOR** effort to increase the amount of alpine maps in the game (stems back to 2019 with *proposed* winter variants of the Crossroads).

## Customization

A lot has happened this year regarding the customization of weapons, so let's see it!

### Furnitures & Alloys

<img src="assets/img/xmasreport-11.png" class="img-large">


In January, 7 new furnitures were added for the FX-05 rifles and carbines. Some were solid colors, but 4 were ***very*** special. These camos haven't seen the light of day in RW since 2019. However, that changes with the reintroduction of these types of camos. Also, the SA80s received a new Tan Furniture and a new Green Furniture - the first ever for the new rifle. The Colt Python and HK21 also received furnitures/alloys as of April and June of 2023 (repsectively).

## Magazines

In 2023, The Thompsons (M1921-M1A1) received a new 20-round box magazine. Other than that (and those of new weapons), this is all there is.

## Attachments

**MANY** attachments were added to Rodblogan Warfare this year. Here are prominent ones:

### Colt Python Barrels

<video  poster="assets/img/xmasreport-10.jpg" autoplay loop muted playsinline class="img-large">
    <source src="assets/img/xmasreport-12.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

Both the stubby and targeting versions of the Colt Python's barrel came back this year. Returning in April, these barrels paved the way for the furniutre additions menitoned above as well as heavy sound changes to the longtime Revolver.

### G3SG/1 Stock

<video  poster="assets/img/xmasreport-10.jpg" autoplay loop muted playsinline class="img-large">
    <source src="assets/img/xmasreport-13.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

The G3SG/1 Stock being added was also major to RW. With the addition of the rail mount, the Stock was just another puzzle piece to complete the construction of a makeshift G3SG/1 rifle **in-game**. Combined with the strengths of the HK31A3 (G3A3 in other games), this stock makes it almost feel real.

### Ultradot PANAV

The PANAV is a new sight that slightly resembles the Kobra in Phantom Forces. The main difference? The reticle is interchangeable **in-game**. This attachment is the first of its kind - an attachment that *immediately* switches to a new reticle when the sight is adjusted. 

### C-More Slide Ride + Gooseneck Mount

<video  poster="assets/img/xmasreport-10.jpg" autoplay loop muted playsinline class="img-large">
    <source src="assets/img/xmasreport-14.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

The C-More Slide Ride was introduced in 2019 for the UMP submachine guns. However, as time went by, it began to show its age. Recently (this year), the C-More has been remodeled - and a new mount is introduced to allow the attachment of this optic on rifles like the M16A1 (yes, that's correct). Above is a GIF of the M16A1 *with* the C-More attached.

### M4A1 Sling

The M4A1's sling may not be important at first glance. However, the addition of its corresponding slot is another story.

### EoTech Holographic Sight

<video  poster="assets/img/xmasreport-10.jpg" autoplay loop muted playsinline class="img-large">
    <source src="assets/img/xmasreport-15.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

A staple of Rodblogan Warfare for nearly **6 years**, this optic has been remodeled as of late. The new look resembles the first remodeleing attempt, but *way* more realistic than that. It is major due to the significance of the sight throughout the game's history (as well as the first-ever attempt at elevation adjustments).


## Character Movement

Character Movement has also been a focus of 2023. Here are some highlights: 

### Swimming

<video  poster="assets/img/xmasreport-10.jpg" autoplay loop muted playsinline class="img-large">
    <source src="assets/img/xmasreport-17.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

Swimming had been in RW since 2019 but was removed in 2021. Then, earlier this year, it came back. Refined with a  new effect, better climb out of the water, and a little more polish, this mechanic is here to stay.



## Weapon Sway (Aimed)

Before, weapons didn't move much when aimed and in motion. Now, that has since changed. Although not as noticeable, the weapon sway has been reinstated and will soon be expanded in 2024. Weapon sway is also dependent on speed, so it won't be arcadey.


## AI

Various improvements have been made to AI in Rodblogan Warfare. One of them was the reinstatement of the Medic's defense (his pistol). Another could be an improved Pilot Crewman AI (when flying). In 2024, there is much more to come regarding AI.

## Weapons

Various weapons have been added to RW (countless, in fact). Here are a few notable entries:

### AKM

<img src="assets/img/xmasreport-18.png" class="img-large">

Yes. Indeed, the AKM has returned. With a new steel material (as well as better handling of the weapon itself) and accompanying variant (the AK-56, or Type 56), this weapon is here to stay and is utilized by various factions (Republic included).

### L85A2

<img src="assets/img/xmasreport-11.png" class="img-large">

As stated before, the L85 returned to RW for the first time in 4 years (as of 2023). This weapon not only received a great face lift, but also some accompanying attachment and funiture upgrades too. The most notable of these? The Furnitures (Tan and Green).

### M16A4

<video  poster="assets/img/xmasreport-10.jpg" autoplay loop muted playsinline class="img-large">
    <source src="assets/img/xmasreport-19.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

The 3-round meanie has also returned (that's right, the M16A4). Despite the US phasing the venerable assault rifle out of their ranks, this weapon is back and here to stay in RW. Featuring more selections of optics, the ability to use the AG-36 (will be the AG-C in standalone), a new furniture and more, We couldn't be happier about it!


## Vehicles

Vehicles also had major improvements in 2023. Here are the most notable ones:

### RSV-95 replaces the RSV-94 in combat

<img src="assets/img/xmasreport-20.png" class="img-large">

The RSV-94 did serve it's purpose (at the time) as a stepping stone to the end goal. Unfortunately (for itself), the end goal has arrived.
The RSV-95 is what you see above this text - an MBT (main battle tank) that now has a machine gun turret for the commander to use when under fire.
Also, the edges of the tank have been refined as well as an improved barrel sight.

### Advent of the RHIB and RHIB-II

<video  poster="assets/img/xmasreport-10.jpg" autoplay loop muted playsinline class="img-large">
    <source src="assets/img/xmasreport-21.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

Smaller boats have arrived to RW. They were a planned feature for many years, but other matters got in the way. Until 2023.

### The replacement of the SKW-62K

<img src="assets/img/xmasreport-22.png" class="img-large">

The PW-56K has officially replaced the SKW-62K. Plans for this were made beforehand, but a fear of losing the charms of the replaced vehicle came about. Then an idea was realized: What if the PW-56 can be the basis of a newer version of the SKW, but better? Then, the PW56K was born.

## RW: Harsh Doorstop

A new endeavour - Rodblogan Warfare: Harsh Doorstop (Edition) has been announced in February of 2023. It's essentially Rodblogan Warfare, but in Operation: Harsh Doorstop. If you want to check out the host game (Harsh Doorstop itself), see the widget below.

<iframe src="https://store.steampowered.com/widget/736590/?t=To%20play%20with%20the%20%20Rodblogan%20Warfare%3A%20Harsh%20Doorstop%20mod%20and%20various%20others%20for%20O%3AHD%2C%20download%20O%3AHD%20today!.%0A%0ANOTE%3A%20RW%3AHD%20is%20still%20under%20construction.%20Should%20be%20available%20by%20the%20end%20of%202024.%0A" frameborder="0" width="646" height="190"></iframe>

Anyways, here are 2023's RW:HD highlights.

### Groundbreaking

<img src="assets/img/scoreboard.png" class="img-large">

After a loss of the original mod due to hardware failure in August, a new version was made. The first mode for RW:HD was (and will be) Lifeline, A high-stakes mode, this mode has no respawns and requires a bit of carefulness to win outright. Lose 75% of your squad and the game is over. Lose you player SL and the game is also over. The objective? Same thing - game over. To ensure that this (and other planned modes) are guaranteed, the scoreboard needed to be changed. The above image is the new scoreboard for the mod (and possibly for the original game itself). Also, emblems were made for both the mod and the game as well ( see the image below).
